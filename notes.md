## Scenarios to support
- No Hosts file created
  Call `Invoke-BundleTask -Name beaker -... <list of beaker vars to override>`
  The following should happen.
  - If no hypervisor and string are specified then the default hypervisor is used and the agent only string is chosen to generate an ephemeral hosts file at the location specified in the `BEAKER_setfile` location.
  - Env vars are set fo the run.
    - A quick parse of the hosts file should be done to determine if this is a master/agent run or agent only and set env vars to match.
  - Ensure we are the top level of the git repo
  - bundle install with defaults for `--path` and allow passing values to `--without` if these tasks have not already been accomplished. An override may exist to wipe and re-install on any given run.
  - `bundle exec rake spec_prep` if this has not already been done.
  - task is invoked. Supported tasks are:
    - rspec patterns
    - rspec test file
    - rspec test file with specified test lines
    - rake tasks
  - When tasks are complete
    - Remove all env vars that were set
    - If an autogenerated hosts file was used, delete it.
      - A hosts file should only have been generated if a hosts file did not already exists at the `BEAKER_setfile` location. An option should exist to auto generate the hosts file but not delete it.
